## Conclusion and Next Steps
Countable was a lot of fun to build. I was so happy to be able to include my friends and family in this project. I am energized by the work and look forward to building it out furter and adding more functionality and features through getting better with React and incorportating more libraries and technologies from the React ecosystem. Formik forms and yup validations are an example of an open source library I included in this project and will now be able to implement into future ones. While I have plans to build more and include likes and follow functionality, I will also spend time reworking areas of my code that could have been written more efficently. I am conscious I have expensive backend queries and as my current database is not extensive it works for this project but sequelze pagination is something I would consider for a larger scale project down the line.
