There is often a footpath only on one side of the street and the area is poorly lit at night time. What I loved about running is the fact that you can do it from your front door. It would be great if there were signposts at the corner of every other street with distances written to the river, university and beach for example. That way, I would be able to find my way to lovely running routes without looking at maps on my phone while I run - which is in itself quite dangerous! Just a thought üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",
